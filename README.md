# AutoInterp Agent Framework

The AutoInterp Agent Framework is an automated system designed for mechanistic interpretability research on Large Language Models (LLMs). It adopts a modular approach in which the research process is broken down into steps that are each executed by an API call to an LLM. The system takes as its input a research question and outputs a research report with original analyses,visualizations, and interpretation.

AutoInterp is still in very early stages and may be buggy. Please feel free to submit pull requests or suggest edits; this is intended to be a community project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies from requirements.txt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akozlo/AutoInterp.git
cd AutoInterp
```

2. Set up a Python environment (choose one option):

**Option A: Use an existing conda/venv environment**

If you already have a conda or venv environment with your desired packages, simply activate it before running AutoInterp. The system will auto-detect and use your active environment:
```bash
conda activate myenv  # or: source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option B: Create a new virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option C: Let AutoInterp handle it**

If you don't activate any environment, AutoInterp will either:
- Use Docker sandbox mode (if Docker is installed) - recommended for security
- Create its own venv at `~/.autointerp/venv` and install dependencies automatically

3. (Optional) Install the package to expose the CLI entry point:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

4. Ensure necessary environment variables are set, either in the environment or in a .env file:

```bash
# Only necessary to provide keys for model providers you will use 
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Huggingface token is needed to download some models from transformers
HF_TOKEN=your_key_here
```

### Configuration

Optionally configure `config.yaml` with custom settings:
   - Task details (name, description)
   - Model configuration
   - LLM provider and model
   - Analysis parameters
   - Visualization settings
   - Resource limits
   - Context pack settings (`context_pack.use_agent`, `context_pack.agent_timeout`)

## Usage

### Running a Task

```bash
# Default run (no install required)
python -m AutoInterp

# Equivalent explicit script call
python main.py

# Override configuration file
python -m AutoInterp --config path/to/override_config.yaml

# Choose where projects are written
python -m AutoInterp --projects-dir /absolute/or/relative/path

# After optional `pip install -e .`
interp-agent --help
```

### arxiv_interp_graph (Context Pack)

AutoInterp ships with the `arxiv_interp_graph` module, which builds a citation graph of interpretability papers and can generate a lightweight context pack. The context pack selects three related papers, downloads their full text (PDF or HTML), and generates research questions — either via an external AI agent (Claude CLI or Codex CLI) or via an LLM API call.

```bash
# Run context pack from the repo root
python main.py context-pack
```

**Question generation strategy:** When the context pack is enabled, the system picks a strategy based on the selected LLM provider:

| Provider | Strategy | CLI tool |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Anthropic | Agent subprocess | `claude` |
| OpenAI | Agent subprocess | `codex` |
| OpenRouter / Manual | LLM API call | — |

The agent reads the downloaded articles (PDFs and HTML files) directly and writes `Research_Questions.txt`. If the agent fails (CLI not installed, timeout, etc.), the system falls back to the LLM API call automatically. Set `context_pack.use_agent: false` in `config.yaml` to always use the LLM API fallback.

**Article download pipeline:** Each paper in the pre-built citation graph (1003 papers) stores an `arxiv_id` or `open_access_url` so downloads work without live API calls in most cases. Papers from Distill and the Transformer Circuits Thread are downloaded as HTML files; all others as PDFs. To re-enrich the graph after adding new papers, run `cd arxiv_interp_graph && python enrich_arxiv_ids.py`.

To use agent mode with Anthropic, install and authenticate the Claude CLI:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash   # install
claude                                             # first run: follow login prompts
```

The generated questions are written to `questions/questions.txt` and then passed through the normal question prioritizer, which selects the best question and extracts a project title.

Key outputs:
- `projects/<project_id>/literature/manifest.json` (paper metadata)
- `projects/<project_id>/literature/pdfs/` (downloaded articles — PDFs and HTML files)
- `projects/<project_id>/literature/Research_Questions.txt` (agent output, if agent was used)
- `projects/<project_id>/questions/questions.txt` (questions for prioritizer)

### Sandboxed Execution with Docker

- Enable the sandbox by setting `analysis.execution.sandbox: true` (default) in `config.yaml`. When enabled, AutoInterp runs generated analysis scripts inside a Docker container instead of directly on the host.
- Configure the container under `execution.docker`:
  - `image`: base image to run (defaults to `python:3.10-slim`; swap for GPU-enabled images such as `pytorch/pytorch:latest` if needed).
  - `use_gpu`: set to `true` to pass through GPUs via `--gpus all` (requires the NVIDIA Container Toolkit).
  - `cache_dir`: persistent host directory where Python packages are installed once and reused across runs.
  - `extra_args`: additional `docker run` flags (for custom networks, resource limits, etc.).
  - `env`: additional environment variables to propagate into the container.
- Hugging Face, pip, and torch caches are mounted automatically so downloads persist between runs. Project artifacts remain on the host because the project directory is bind-mounted read/write.
